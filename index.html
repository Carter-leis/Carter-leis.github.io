              <p style="background-color: lightgray">I am a senior at University of St. Thomas. Over the past 4 years, I had the ability to experience this school to its fullest.
                I am majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Data Analytics. I believe pairing these two fields together will give me a broad range of jobs that I will be able to do and succeed at.
                I have worked for the school in ITS for the past 3 years. I have worked in multiple different postions during those years. I have gained valuable experience from these different positions.
                One of which is being able to learn what is need from and performing that at a very high level. Working while being in school has taught me how to use my time wisely to be able to complete
                everything that I need to do with homework, learning about the job, and being in a club sport. I played lacrosse here at UST and I had the privilage of being a captian.
                We were a very succesful even though Covid made it increaseing difficult to field a high level team. If you are interested in looking at my Linkedin, here is the link to do so.

            <p style="background-color: lightgray">
              After college I plan on finding a job in the field of Computer Science or Data Analytics. I currently don't have a preference on either.
              If the job is in Data Analytics, I would hope for a job that I can still use my Computer Science skill set. If not, I would want to be able to
              work my way into such job in Data Analytics. I graduate in December of 2021, so I am looking for a job that I could start in January. I'm excited
              to start a new part of my life and I will work hard to be able to succeed at it.
